### What is it?
The Galaxy Sound Engine is a multi-effects sound processing app.
I'm using [AudioKit](https://audiokit.io/) framework for what is essentially a "Guitar Multi-Effects Pedal".

### How is it different?
The idea is to allow the user (musician) to add and rearrange multiple effects in whatever order they want to explore and create sounds.
